# Redirect Chain Fix - PixelWave Website

## Problem Identified
Google Search Console detected redirect chain issues affecting your website's SEO:
- Multiple URL variations causing redirect chains
- URLs not being indexed properly
- Affecting 3 pages with redirect issues

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple URL variations**: `http://`, `https://`, `www.`, and non-www versions
2. **No canonical redirects**: All variations were accessible without proper redirection
3. **Missing redirect rules**: No server-level redirects to consolidate URLs

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated `public/_redirects` File
```
# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
http://usepixelwave.com/* https://usepixelwave.com/:splat 301!
http://www.usepixelwave.com/* https://usepixelwave.com/:splat 301!

# Redirect www to non-www
https://www.usepixelwave.com/* https://usepixelwave.com/:splat 301!

# Handle root redirects
http://usepixelwave.com/ https://usepixelwave.com/ 301!
http://www.usepixelwave.com/ https://usepixelwave.com/ 301!
https://www.usepixelwave.com/ https://usepixelwave.com/ 301!

# SPA fallback for all other routes
/* /index.html 200
```

### 2. Enhanced `public/_headers` File
- Added `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` for non-canonical URLs
- Added cache control headers to prevent redirect caching issues
- Maintained security headers

### 3. Updated `public/robots.txt`
- Added `Host: https://usepixelwave.com` directive
- Helps search engines understand canonical domain

### 4. Enhanced `next.config.js`
- Added server-side redirects for www and HTTP variations
- Added canonical link headers
- Proper domain configuration

### 5. Created Test Page
- `public/test-redirects.html` to verify redirect functionality
- Test all URL variations and confirm proper redirection

## Canonical URL Structure
**Primary (Canonical)**: `https://usepixelwave.com/`
**Redirects to canonical**:
- `http://usepixelwave.com/` → `https://usepixelwave.com/`
- `http://www.usepixelwave.com/` → `https://usepixelwave.com/`
- `https://www.usepixelwave.com/` → `https://usepixelwave.com/`

## Expected Results
1. ✅ **Eliminate redirect chains**: All variations redirect directly to canonical
2. ✅ **Consolidate link equity**: All SEO value flows to canonical URL
3. ✅ **Improve indexing**: Google will index only the canonical version
4. ✅ **Resolve GSC warnings**: Redirect chain issues should disappear

## Testing Instructions
1. Visit `https://usepixelwave.com/test-redirects.html`
2. Test each redirect link
3. Verify 301 status codes in browser network tab
4. Confirm no redirect chains occur

## Monitoring
- Check Google Search Console for redirect chain warnings
- Monitor crawl stats for canonical URL
- Verify all variations redirect properly
- Check for any remaining indexing issues

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy changes** to your hosting platform
2. **Test redirects** using the test page
3. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console
4. **Request reindexing** for affected pages
5. **Monitor GSC** for resolution of warnings

## Technical Notes
- All redirects use 301 (permanent) status codes
- SPA fallback maintained for React routing
- Security headers preserved
- SEO meta tags already properly configured
- Sitemap uses canonical URLs

## Timeline for Resolution
- **Immediate**: Redirects active upon deployment
- **1-2 weeks**: Google begins recognizing canonical URLs
- **2-4 weeks**: Redirect chain warnings should resolve
- **4-8 weeks**: Full indexing recovery expected
